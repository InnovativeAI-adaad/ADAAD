# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Completed PR-5 sandbox hardening with deterministic manifest/policy validation, syscall/fs/network/resource checks, and replayable sandbox evidence hashing.
- Added checkpoint registry and verifier modules, entropy policy/detector primitives, and hardened sandbox isolation evidence plumbing for PR-3/PR-4/PR-5 continuation.
- Added deterministic promotion event creation and priority-based promotion policy engine with unit tests.
- Mutation executor promotion integration now enforces valid transition edges and fail-closed policy rejection (`promotion_policy_rejected`).
- Completed PR-1 scoring foundation modules: deterministic scoring algorithm, scoring validator, and append-only scoring ledger with determinism tests.
- Added replay-safe determinism provider abstraction (`runtime.governance.foundation.determinism`) and wired provider injection through mutation executor, epoch manager, evolution governor, promotion manifest writer, and ledger snapshot recovery paths.
- Added governance schema validation policy, validator module/script, and draft-2020-12 governance schemas (`scoring_input`, `scoring_result`, `promotion_policy`, `checkpoint`, `manifest`) with tests.
- Deterministic governance foundation helpers under `runtime.governance.foundation` (`canonical`, `hashing`, `clock`) with compatibility adapters under top-level `governance.*`.
- Evolution governance helpers for deterministic checkpoint digests, promotion transition enforcement, and authority score clamping/threshold resolution.
- Unit tests covering governance foundation canonicalization/hash determinism and promotion state transitions.

### Changed
- Added deterministic replay-seed issuance/validation across governor, mutation executor, manifest schema, and manifest validator plus replay runtime parity integration tests.
- Replay, promotion manifest, baseline hashing, governor certificate fallback checkpoint digest, and law-evolution certificate hashing now use canonical runtime governance hashing/clock utilities.
- Runtime import root policy now explicitly allows `governance` compatibility adapters.
- Governance documentation now defines canonical runtime import paths and adapter expectations.

### Added
- Verbose boot diagnostics strengthened with replay mode normalization echo, fail-closed state output, replay score output, replay summary block, replay manifest path output, and explicit boot completion marker.
- `QUICKSTART.md` expanded with package sanity checks and first-time strict replay baseline guidance.
- Governance surfaces table in README and architecture legend in `docs/assets/architecture-simple.svg`.
- Bug template field for expected governance surface to accelerate triage.

### Changed
- Added deterministic replay-seed issuance/validation across governor, mutation executor, manifest schema, and manifest validator plus replay runtime parity integration tests.
- README clarified staging-only mutation semantics for production posture.
- CONTRIBUTING now requires strict replay verification for governance-impact PRs and adds determinism guardrails.

## 0.65.0 - Initial import of ADAAD He65 tree

- Established canonical `User-ready-ADAAD` tree with five-element ownership (Earth, Wood, Fire, Water, Metal).
- Added Cryovant gating with ledger/keys scaffolding and certification checks to block uncertified Dream/Beast execution.
- Normalized imports to canonical roots and consolidated metrics into `reports/metrics.jsonl`.
- Introduced deterministic orchestrator boot order, warm pool startup, and minimal Aponi dashboard endpoints.
