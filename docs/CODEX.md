- Boot Identity: **Health-First**
- Gatekeeper: **Cryovant** (ledger+mirror, certify_or_quarantine)
- Architect Governance: proposals + policy violations
- Mutation Flow: Dream sandbox → Cryovant verify → Metrics append
- Observability: Aponi `/metrics`, `/lineage`, runtime/logs

## Phase II: Convergence & Ascent
- Objective: unify Cryovant, Dream Mode, Architect Agent, Beast Loop, Aponi, and Earth into a single deterministic evolutionary system.
- Governance: Cryovant certification and quarantine are mandatory ingress/egress gates.
- Directed Mutation: Dream Mode supports file-level mutation and records sandbox latency for fitness calculations.
- Scheduling: Beast Loop coordinates continuous ticks for mutation, scoring, and promotion decisions.
- Observability: Aponi surfaces survival trends, lineage graphs, and governance proposal feeds.
- Resilience: Health-first boot blocks unsafe cycles; runtime logging captures lifecycle events for auditing.
