# Codex Briefing — Phase IV: Scaled Evolution

Phase IV drives ADAAD from directed autonomy into scaled, multi-agent evolution. Key upgrades:

- **Population engine**: agents live under `app/agents/lineage/<agent_id>/` with dna/meta/certificate snapshots and JSONL state mirrors.
- **Beast Loop parallelism**: multiple parents selected per tick, producing offspring with lineage links, Cryovant certification, and sandbox fitness scoring.
- **Mutation diversity hooks**: file-level mutations remain sandboxed while enabling structural growth across the population.
- **Cryovant law**: lineage metadata, quarantine, and certification checks continue to guard every artifact.
- **Aponi multi-lineage telemetry**: dashboard endpoints now expose population, per-agent lineage, certifications, fitness, and mutation histories.
- **Runtime safeguards**: population seeding, per-cycle metrics, and logging create the foundation for safe concurrency scaling.

Use `python app/main.py` to run an orchestrated cycle and `python ui/aponi_dashboard.py` to observe metrics, lineage, population, and certification streams.
