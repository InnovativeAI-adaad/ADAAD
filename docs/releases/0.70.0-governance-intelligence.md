# ADAAD 0.70.0 Release Notes (Draft)

## Title

ADAAD 0.70.0 — Governance Intelligence Surface

## Highlights

- Aponi promoted from telemetry view to deterministic governance intelligence console.
- Added read-only replay forensics endpoints:
  - `GET /replay/divergence`
  - `GET /replay/diff?epoch_id=...` (now includes deterministic `semantic_drift` classification counts + per-key assignments)
- Formalized governance health model (`v1.0.0`) with deterministic thresholds.
- Added `GET /risk/instability` deterministic early-warning metric projection with additive momentum signals (`instability_velocity`, `instability_acceleration`), confidence intervals, and velocity-spike anomaly detection.
- Added read-only `GET /policy/simulate` for deterministic policy outcome comparison.
- Added read-only `GET /alerts/evaluate` for deterministic severity-bucketed governance alert evaluation.
- Added CSP + no-store response hardening for HTML governance surface.

## Safety Classification

- Risk: Low
- Blast radius: UI/API read-only surface
- Mutation authority changes: None
- Replay authority changes: None

## Verification Checklist

- Import root and smoke tests pass.
- Dashboard module compiles.
- Aponi UI boots and exposes new read-only endpoints.

## Notes

Governance command surfaces remain intentionally out of scope until replay forensics coverage is complete.
