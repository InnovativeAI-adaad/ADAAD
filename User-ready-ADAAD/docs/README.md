# docs

Documentation is the system contract.
If docs and code disagree, fix code or fix docs immediately.

## Required documents

1) Architecture and element mapping
  - explain Five-Element alignment
  - list boot order
  - define what is allowed to run when uncertified

2) Governance
  - Cryovant rules
  - Policy rules
  - Promotion and lineage rules

3) Contribution constraints
  - no new top-level dirs
  - no non-canonical imports
  - no bypassing policy
  - no bypassing Cryovant

Keep docs short, exact, and test-backed.
