  "description": "Replace _safe_print usage with canonical logger import and emit structured boot logs.",
  "requirements": [
    "Replace _safe_print usage in the boot path with logger calls.",
    "Use canonical import: from runtime.logger import get_logger (or equivalent).",
    "Emit exactly two boot lines: info: boot start; audit: boot ok (or error on failure)."
  ],
  "deliverables": [
    "app/main.py (or runtime entrypoint) uses the logger instead of print/safe_print.",
    "Boot execution writes JSONL events under data/logs/."
  ],
  "acceptance": [
    "Boot emits info boot start and audit boot ok/error to data/logs/*.jsonl.",
    "No print/_safe_print calls remain in the boot path."
